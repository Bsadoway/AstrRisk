AstrRisk
=====================

AstrRisk is a data visualization app that allows users to view Near Earth Objects (NEOs) that are between Mars and Earth on any given day.

Features a custom-made browsing UI built with CSS3 and D3js. Users can browse through 300 years worth of information dating back to 1900 and all the way up to 2200 based on NASA's predictions.

Radar and danger charts provide easy to digest information about individual NEOs. Heatmaps allow user to see an overview of each year's NEO density's at a glance and to quickly navigate to a particular day.

Future goals
=======================
- Deployment of the app
